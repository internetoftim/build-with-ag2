- This project referenced the AG2 notebook [task solving with code generation, execution, and debugging](https://docs.ag2.ai/notebooks/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution#a-comparative-analysis-of-meta-and-tesla-stocks-in-early-2024)

This project retrieves news and stock price changes for a given stock symbol (e.g., AAPL) and generates a summarized market analysis report.

## Details

- Getting 5 news from Yahoo Finance
- Getting stock price changes with Python Code, and plot a 1-year stock price change graph.
- Summarized report and analysis report generation in `market_analysis_report.md`, including a conclusion to buy, sell, or hold the stock. Note this is not a financial advice, but a demonstration of how AG2 can help with financial analysis.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2.git
cd financial-analysis
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code

Before running the demo, you need to set up your OpenAI API configuration:

1. Create a file named `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` in the project root:

```bash
cp OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample OAI_CONFIG_LIST
```

2. Edit the `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` file to include your OpenAI API configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  }
]
```

The configuration file supports multiple model configurations. For more details on available options and advanced configurations, refer to the [AutoGen configuration guide](https://docs.ag2.ai/getting-started#configuration).

## Run the Demo

```bash
python main.py
```

At the `Enter the stock you want to investigate: ` prompt, enter the stock symbol or stock name you want to investigate. For example, you can enter `AAPL` for Apple Inc. stock.

Checkout the generated `market_analysis_report.md` file for the summarized market analysis report.
