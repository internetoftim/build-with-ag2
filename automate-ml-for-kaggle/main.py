For example, you can:
- get the shape of the dataset
- get the first several rows of the dataset
- get the information of the dataset use `df.info()` or `df.describe()`
- plot the plots as needed (i.e. histogram, distribution)
- check the missing values
Only perform necessary data exploration steps.

If a data preprocessing step is performed, you only need to check whether the changes are good. Perform the exploration on the data as needed.
You should not train models in any time. If you think the data is ready and there are no more exploration or processing steps needed, please reply with "Ready for training".

3. Convert categorical variables to numerical variables
4. Scale numerical variables

Please split the train data into 30% test and 70% train. If it is already done, please use the existing split.
You don't need to repeat previous code snippets.
Please reason about the choice of the model and select the one you think is the best for the task. For example, you can use models like but not limited to LinearRegression, RandomForestModel, GradientBoostingModel, CartModel, DistributedGradientBoostingModel, etc.
Each time, based on previous results, you should try a different model, or a different set of hyperparameters if you think this current model can be improved. And then evaluate the model on the test split.
Do not perform any hyperparameter tuning like grid search. Please try different models or different hyperparameters directly based on your intuition.

If you are asked to never use particular models, please do not use them even if they are better.

When you run  model training, I would like you to generate the performance metrics, you can use these visualisations but not limited to loss curves, confusion matrix, auc, classification report, etc. Save it as an image.
